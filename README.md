# Description
This repository contains a simple yet functional Caesar Cipher program written in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This program allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by entering the desired shift value.

# Features
Encryption and Decryption: The program can either encrypt or decrypt a given message based on a shift value specified by the user.Customizable Shift Value: The shift value determines the character displacement in the alphabet.
Handles Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: The program correctly processes both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving letter case.
Character Ignorance: Non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation) remain unchanged.

# Usage
Run the Program: Start the program by running the main file.
Choose Mode: The program will prompt whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
Enter Message: Enter the text want to encrypt or decrypt.
Input Shift Value: Enter an integer for the shift value.
View Output: The program displays the encrypted or decrypted message.

# Example
If a user chooses to encrypt the text "Hello World" with a shift of 10, the encrypted output will be "Rovvy Gybvn".
If a user chooses to decrypt the text "Rovvy Gybvn" with the same shift, they will receive "Hello World".
